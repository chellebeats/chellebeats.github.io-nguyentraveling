      <h2>My Time as a Chicagoan</h2>
      <p>Every year, my boyfriend and I always travel for our birthdays. This year I thought, "What better place to go than his hometown of Chicago?" I had never been and was excited to take in this Midwest metropolitan city.
      <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
      <p>Our first day was so exciting! It was my first time to a MLB game and I got to experience it at Wrigley Field with the Chicago Cubs who just won the World Series the year before. It was kind of magical. <em>The comradery, the beautiful weather, and the nolstagic stadium</em> made this an experience I would never forget! Especially because we had the chance to keep a foul ball from one of the players. When I got the ball, I thought "What a great way to remember this trip!" Unfortunately, it hit the guy seated next to me in the neck before I grabbed it and I could not in good conscience keep it for ourself.

      <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
      <p>We visited <em>Millennium Park</em> and the <em>Art Institute of Chicago</em>.<br><br> Both places are a must when visiting the city. I would recommend at least 3 hours for the museum. </p>

      <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
      <p>When traveling, we always like to add a day in for shopping. We visited the "hipster" neighborhood of <em>Wicker Park</em> to visit some local thrift stores. We also went to the <em>Randolph St. Market Festival</em>, which had lots of antique and vintage goodies.</p>
